Snake Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python and Pygame library. In this game, the player controls a snake that moves around the screen and eats fruits to grow longer. The player needs to avoid running into the walls or into the snake's own body. The game ends when the snake hits the wall or runs into its own body.


Instructions
1. Make sure you have Python and Pygame library installed on your system.
2. Run the Python script snake_game.py using a Python interpreter.
3. Use the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to control the snake's direction.
4. Try to eat as many fruits as possible without running into the walls or into the snake's own body.
5. The game ends when the snake hits the wall or runs into its own body.
6. After the game ends, you can restart the game by running the script again
