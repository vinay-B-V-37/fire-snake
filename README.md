Snake Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python and Pygame library. In this game, the player controls a snake that moves around the screen and eats fruits to grow longer. The player needs to avoid running into the walls or into the snake's own body. The game ends when the snake hits the wall or runs into its own body.


Instructions
1. Make sure you have Python and Pygame library installed on your system.
2. Run the Python script snake_game.py using a Python interpreter.
3. Use the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to control the snake's direction.
4. Try to eat as many fruits as possible without running into the walls or into the snake's own body.
5. The game ends when the snake hits the wall or runs into its own body.
6. After the game ends, you can restart the game by running the script again



Game Features
* The snake moves at a constant speed, which can be adjusted by changing the snake_speed variable.
* The game window has a size of 720x480 pixels, which can be adjusted by changing the window_x and window_y variables.
* The snake's body grows longer by 1 block each time it eats a fruit.
* The player's score is displayed on the screen, and it increases by 5 each time the snake eats a fruit.
* The fruit spawns randomly on the screen after the snake eats a fruit or at the start of the game.
* The game ends when the snake hits the wall or runs into its own body.
* The game over screen displays the player's final score, and the game automatically restarts after a 2-second delay.


Controls
1. UP arrow key: Change snake's direction to UP
2. DOWN arrow key: Change snake's direction to DOWN
3. LEFT arrow key: Change snake's direction to LEFT
4. RIGHT arrow key: Change snake's direction to RIGHT



Dependencies
This game uses the Pygame library, which is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. Pygame provides functionality for drawing graphics, playing sounds, handling input events, and more, making it suitable for developing 2D games like Snake.

To install Pygame, you can use the following command:

pip install pygame



How to Play
1. Install Python and Pygame library if not already installed.
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3. Run the snake_game.py file using Python.
4. Use the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to control the snake.
5. Eat the fruits to increase your score.
6. Avoid hitting the window boundaries or touching the snake's own body.
7. The game ends when the snake hits the window boundaries or touches its own body.
8. The final score will be displayed on the game over screen.


Acknowledgements
This game is based on the classic Snake game and was developed using Pygame, a popular game development library for Python. Thanks to the Pygame community for providing a powerful and easy-to-use platform for game development in Python.
